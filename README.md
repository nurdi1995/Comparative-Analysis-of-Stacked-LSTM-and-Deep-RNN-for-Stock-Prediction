# Comparative-Analysis-of-Stacked-LSTM-and-Deep-RNN-for-Stock-Prediction
The results show that the Deep RNN model in the fourth scenario provided the most accurate predictions, with the highest Dstat value of 73.26%. On the other hand, the Stacked LSTM model performed best with 1000 epochs, showing the lowest loss and good performance measured by MSE and RMSE.
